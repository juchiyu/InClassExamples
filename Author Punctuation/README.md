## French and English authors and their punctuations

#### Folders

+ 0_Code to get the data: the R script to extract the data from the Gutengurg project and generate the contingency table.

+ 1_Preliminary analysis: the scipt with which I used to run a quick pass of CA and the plots from the anlaysis.

+ Data: two .rda files that store the contingency tables respectively of the French 
(AllAuthorPunct_Fr.rda) and English (AllAuthorPunct.rda) authors

	+ Both .rda files have two tables inside:

		+ the simple one with punctuations categorized as *comma*, *period*, and *other*

		+ the complex one with all different types of *other* punctuations in the columns

+ I have created two folders respectively for Luke and Kirthana, so they can keep their works separated to avoid possible conflicts.
